Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones, anticyclones, troughs and ridges. At the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential height of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.<br/><br/>The units of this parameter are geopotential metres. A geopotential metre is approximately 2% shorter than a geometric metre.","unit_id":28,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2","netcdf"],"access_ids":["dissemination"],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":157,"name":"Relative humidity","shortname":"r","description":"This parameter is the water vapour pressure as a percentage of the value at which the air becomes saturated (the point at which water vapour begins to condense into liquid water or deposition into ice).<br/><br/>For temperatures over 0&deg;C (273.15 K) it is calculated for saturation over water.

Snowfall is the sum of large-scale snowfall and convective snowfall. Large-scale snowfall is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System. The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale snowfall due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. Convective snowfall is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS. The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.

For example, satellites measure SST in a layer a few microns thick in the uppermost mm of the ocean, drifting buoys measure SST at a depth of about 0.2-1.5m, whereas ships sample sea water down to about 10m, while the vessel is underway. Deeper measurements are not affected by changes that occur during a day, due to the rising and setting of the Sun (diurnal variations).<br/><br/>Sometimes SST is taken from a forecast made by coupling the NEMO ocean model to the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. In this case, the SST is the average temperature of the uppermost metre of the ocean and does exhibit diurnal variations.<br/><br/> <a href='https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/17117-part-iv-physical-processes.pdf#section.H.10'>See further SST documentation</a>.","unit_id":2,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":["dissemination"],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":171035,"name":"Ice surface temperature anomaly layer 1","shortname":"istal1","description":"","unit_id":2,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":171036,"name":"Ice surface temperature anomaly layer 2","shortname":"istal2","description":"","unit_id":2,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":171037,"name":"Ice surface temperature anomaly layer 3","shortname":"istal3","description":"","unit_id":2,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":171038,"name":"Ice surface temperature anomaly layer 4","shortname":"istal4","description":"","unit_id":2,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":171039,"name":"Volumetric soil water anomaly layer 1","shortname":"swval1","description":"An anomaly is a difference from a defined long-term average.

Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. <a href='https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2016/16648-part-iv-physical-processes.pdf#chapter.10'>See further documentation</a>.<br/><br/>Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms.<br/><br/>In the IFS, the units for total ozone are kilograms per square metre, but before 12/06/2001 dobson units were used. Dobson units (DU) are still used extensively for total column ozone. 1 DU = 2.1415E-5 kg m-2.","unit_id":22,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":["dissemination"],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":171207,"name":"10 metre wind speed anomaly","shortname":"10sia","description":"An anomaly is a difference from a defined long-term average.

Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air.<br/><br/>This parameter is accumulated over a <a href='https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5%3A+data+documentation#ERA5:datadocumentation-Meanrates/fluxesandaccumulations'>particular time period which depends on the data extracted</a>.\n<br>[NOTE: See 231005 for the equivalent parameter in \"kg m-2\"]","unit_id":4,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":["dissemination"],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":228252,"name":"Irrigation","shortname":"irr","description":"","unit_id":4,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":228253,"name":"ASCAT first soil moisture CDF matching parameter","shortname":"ascat_sm_cdfa","description":null,"unit_id":10,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":228254,"name":"ASCAT second soil moisture CDF matching parameter","shortname":"ascat_sm_cdfb","description":null,"unit_id":23,"encoding_ids":["grib1","grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":228255,"name":"Surface long wave-effective total cloudiness","shortname":"tcclw","description":"Let SSRD and STRD be the surface downward short-wave and long-wave radiation at the surface, and SSRDC and STRDC the surface clear-sky downward short-wave and long-wave radiation at the surface.\r\n\r\nThe short-wave and long-wave radiation-effective total cloudiness are\r\nthe equivalent cloud fractions of the sky that would give the surface\r\ndownward radiation, without reference to any cloud overlap assumption,\r\nany specification (liquid droplets or ice particles) of cloud particles,\r\nand related cloud optical properties.\r\nIn particular, TCCSW, the surface short-wave-effective total cloudiness\r\nis what might be the closest to what the \"person in the street\" could\r\nthink of as total cloudiness.\r\n\r\nComputationally speaking, TCCSW = 1 - SSRD / SSRDC\r\nand TCCLW = 1 - STRDC / STRD\r\n\r\n(the difference in the ratios is due to the fact that, w.r.t. to clear\r\nsky conditions, clouds decrease the amount of short-wave radiation\r\nusually available at the surface, whereas clouds actually increase the\r\namount of long-wave radiation available at the surface).","unit_id":23,"encoding_ids":["grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":229001,"name":"Urban cover","shortname":"cur","description":"This parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) that is covered with an urban surface.\r\nThis parameter includes all impervious and\r\nartificial surfaces (e.g. roads, buildings, parking lots, etc.).","unit_id":3,"encoding_ids":["grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":229002,"name":"Road Cover","shortname":"cro","description":"This parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) that is covered with a flat impervious surface (including paved areas and bridges).\r\n","unit_id":3,"encoding_ids":["grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":229003,"name":"Building cover","shortname":"cbu","description":"This parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) that is covered with an elevated impervious surface (e.g. buildings).\r\n","unit_id":3,"encoding_ids":["grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":229004,"name":"Building height","shortname":"bldh","description":"This parameter contains the mean building height.","unit_id":4,"encoding_ids":["grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":229005,"name":"Vertical-to-horizontal area ratio","shortname":"hwr","description":"This parameter is the ratio of total building wall area to the plan area of urban cover.","unit_id":19,"encoding_ids":["grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":229006,"name":"Standard deviation of building height","shortname":"bhstd","description":"This parameter is the standard deviation of building heights of the grid box","unit_id":4,"encoding_ids":["grib2"],"access_ids":[],"published":true,"pending":false,"retired":false},{"id":229007,"name":"Wetland cover","shortname":"cwe","description":"This parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) which is inundated.
