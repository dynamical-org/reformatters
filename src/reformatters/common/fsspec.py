    Apply a method to the filesystem with retry logic.

    This function handles both sync and async filesystems. The fsspec local filesystem is sync,
    but the fsspec store from zarr.storage.FsspecStore is async, so we need to handle both cases.
    (The AsyncFileSystem wrapper on LocalFilesystem raises NotImplementedError when _put is called
    so we can't just use that.)
